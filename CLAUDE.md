# Project Guidelines

## Executing bash commands

IMPORTANT: Use simple commands that you have permission to execute. Avoid complex commands that may fail due to permission issues.

When copying or moving files:
- Avoid compound commands with `&&` - run commands separately
- Avoid wildcard patterns (`*.java`) - copy files individually
- Single-file operations are more reliable with Bash permission system

## Skills

IMPORTANT: Always invoke the relevant skill before performing these actions:

- **Before creating git commits**: Use the `idea-to-code:commit-guidelines` skill
- **When practicing TDD**: Use the `idea-to-code:tdd` skill
- **When working from a plan file**: Use the `idea-to-code:plan-tracking` skill
- **When creating Dockerfiles**: Use the `idea-to-code:dockerfile-guidelines` skill
- **When moving/renaming files**: Use the `idea-to-code:file-organization` skill
- **When writing multiple similar files**: Use the `idea-to-code:incremental-development` skill

## Code Style

IMPORTANT: Prefer intention-revealing method names over comments. If you find yourself writing a comment to explain what code does, extract it into a method whose name conveys the intent. This applies to ALL code — production, tests, scripts. Never write comments like `// Verify X is installed` — instead extract a function like `verifyXInstalled()`. Follow this rule even when surrounding code uses inline comments.

## Tool Selection

IMPORTANT: Before running any Bash command, ask: "Is there a specialized tool for this?"

- File search → Glob (NOT find or ls)
- Content search → Grep (NOT grep or rg)
- Read files → Read (NOT cat/head/tail)

The specialized tools are faster, have correct permissions, and provide better output formatting.

## Git Commands

IMPORTANT: Always run git commands from the project root directory. If you need to operate on the repository, cd to the root directory first rather than using `git -C`. This prevents accidentally committing files outside the project root.

## Pattern-Based Fixes

When fixing issues caused by naming conventions or patterns:
1. Search the entire codebase for similar occurrences before making any changes
2. Fix ALL instances in a single commit
3. Never commit partial fixes for pattern-based problems
